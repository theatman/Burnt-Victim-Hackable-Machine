# Burnt Victim Hackable Machine 
For Pentesting or educational use only


Burnt Victim is a hackable machine that can be used as an educational or practice Pentesting tool for Red Teamers. There are at least 3 different ways to get the user and root flags using various tools and techniques. The machine is designed for beginners or novices at hacking. 

I hope you have fun and that you try as many different ways as possible to capture the flags! 

GETTING STARTED

1. Download the OVA file (size: 14 GB). (Download link below)
2. Export OVA into VirtualBox or VMWare.
3. Make sure that Network Settings on your VM for the machine are set as "Host-only adapter."

NOTE: You will not be provided with passwords to log-in because the goal here is that you will have to find your way into the machine. Also, please do not read the Walkthrough provided unless you really can't figure out how to hack into it.
